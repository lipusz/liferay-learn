# Upgrading Search for Liferay 7.3

Upgrading Liferay requires some additional steps to upgrade the search experience:

- Backing up your Elasticsearch indexes
- Installing Elasticsearch 7.9+ (and the plugins Liferay requires)
- Connecting Liferay to Elasticsearch (may require a new connector)
- Re-indexing the Workflow Metrics, Company, and System indexes from their dedicated user interfaces
- Restoring the Search Tuning indexes from a snapshot (when upgrading from Liferay DXP 7.2 FP2+/SP1+)

## Search Upgrade Overview

The list above just scratches the surface of the search upgrade picture: it doesn't cover any more complicated scenarios (like if you have Liferay Enterprise Search modules to upgrade as well). Find the scenario that matches your Liferay version, LES version (if using LES), and your current search engine stack. Use the *Upgrade Steps* column to guide the upgrade.

## Common Upgrade Steps

```important::
   `Back up the search indexes <./backing-up-elasticsearch.md>`__ before proceeding with these steps.
```

Upgrade scenarios for systems not including LES apps will include these steps:

1. Move to Elasticsearch 7.9+: [upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.9+](upgrading-to-elasticsearch-7.md) or [install Elasticsearch 7.9+](../installing-elasticsearch.md) depending on your pre-upgrade stack.

1. [Connect Liferay to Elasticsearch 7.9+](../connecting-to-elasticsearch.md)

1. [Configure security.](../securing-elasticsearch.md)

1. [Upgrade Liferay.](../../../../installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/upgrade-basics/upgrade-overview.md)

1. [Re-index the search and spell check indexes.](../../../../installation-and-upgrades/upgrading-liferay/upgrade-basics/post-upgrade-considerations.md)

1. [Re-index the Workflow Metrics indexes.](../../../../process-automation/workflow/user-guide/workflow-metrics-reports.md#re-indexing-workflow-metrics)

1. Test the search experience in the upgraded system to ensure everything is working as expected.

## LES Upgrade Steps

```important::
   `Back up the search indexes <./backing-up-elasticsearch.md>`__ before proceeding with these steps.
```

Systems using LES apps will use these additional steps to upgrade besides the common upgrade steps shown above:

1. Install Kibana 7.9+ if you are currently using Kibana and Monitoring.

1. Install and configure LES Monitoring app if you are currently using Kibana and Elasticsearch Monitoring/X-Pack Monitoring.

1. Install LES Learning to Rank app if you are currently using this in your environment.


## Test the Upgraded Search Experience

Manually test the upgraded search experience to ensure the features you depend on work as expected. If something is not working or behaving differently than you expect, review [Liferay's Breaking Changes](./../../../../liferay-internals/reference/7-3-breaking-changes.md).

## LES Applications Renamed

> **LES Subscribers**

Though not explicitly linked to the Liferay CE/DXP 7.3 release, these apps were renamed to better reflect their functionality and to emphasize their identity as LES apps:

| Functionality | Old App Name | New App Name | 7.2 Configuration File | 7.3 Configuration File |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |------------ | ------------ |
| Monitoring the Elasticsearch cluster | Liferay Connector to X-Pack Monitoring [Elastic Stack 6.x] | Liferay Enterprise Search Monitoring | `com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.xpack.monitoring.web.internal.configuration.XPackMonitoringConfiguration.config` | `com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.monitoring.web.internal.configuration.MonitoringConfiguration.config` |
| Securing the Elasticsearch cluster | Liferay Connector to X-Pack Security [Elastic Stack 6.x] | Liferay Enterprise Search Security | No action required, this app is not available for DXP 7.3, features are integrated into the Elasticsearch 7 connector bundled with DXP 7.3. |
| Using machine learning to optimize the search algorithm | Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch Learning to Rank | Liferay Enterprise Search Learning to Rank | No changes. |

For Liferay 7.2 widget and configuration names were unchanged. In Liferay 7.3 the monitoring widget and the configurations were renamed.

The renaming of apps and configurations has the following upgrade impacts:
1. The LES Monitoring widget is now named  *Elasticsearch Monitoring*. During portal startup, a module upgrade step runs, renaming the app when _Liferay Enterprise Search Monitoring_ for DXP 7.3 is deployed. No action is required.
1. The name of configuration file changed from `com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.xpack.monitoring.web.internal.configuration.XPackMonitoringConfiguration.config` to `com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.monitoring.web.internal.configuration.MonitoringConfiguration`. The properties are the same as before. During portal startup, a module upgrade step runs, renaming the configuration. No action is required.
1. The Kibana base path to the monitoring widget has changed. You must change the original setting in `kibana.yml`:

   ```yaml
   server.basePath: "/o/portal-search-elasticsearch-xpack-monitoring/xpack-monitoring-proxy"
   ```

   to

   ```yaml
   server.basePath: "/o/portal-search-elasticsearch-monitoring/monitoring-proxy"
   ```

Liferay 7.3 supports only Elasticsearch 7.9+ via the out-of-the-box Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch 7. The matrix of pre-upgrade stacks you are migrating from is more numerous, and it's important to understand the high-level steps required to safely navigate from your existing stack to the Liferay 7.3 stack.  The most basic scenario includes

## What's Next 

Now that you know your upgrade path, start upgrading to use Liferay 7.3 with the latest [Elasticsearch](./upgrading-to-elasticsearch-7.md) (recommended) or [Solr](../../solr.rst) (now deprecated as of Liferay 7.3) search engine.
