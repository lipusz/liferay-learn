A Liferay Enterprise Search (LES) subscription gets you additional features beyond what's available out of the box with your Liferay DXP subscription. It includes

-  :doc:`/using-search/liferay-enterprise-search/cross_cluster_replication`
-  :doc:`/using-search/liferay-enterprise-search/learning-to-rank`
-  Monitoring Elasticsearch
-  `Securing Elasticsearch <./installing-and-upgrading-a-search-engine/elasticsearch/securing-elasticsearch.md>`__ [Free without LES for Liferay CE and DXP with Elasticsearch 7] 

.. important::
   Always check the `LES compatibility matrix <https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651#Liferay-Enterprise-Search>`__ for compatibility information.

To see a detailed description of the services and features included with LES on your version of Liferay DXP, refer to the official description of LES in `Liferay's DXP Components resource Liferay Enterprise Search <https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014400932>`__.  

Detailed installation and usage instructions are available in the article for each LES feature.

.. note::
   Out of the box, X-Pack comes with a `30-day trial <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/start-trial.html>`__.  This can be useful if there's a delay between your subscription and receipt of your production X-Pack license.
