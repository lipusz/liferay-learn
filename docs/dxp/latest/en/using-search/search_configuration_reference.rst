Search in Liferay DXP can be configured in lots of ways. Once you understand the concept of `configuration scope <../system-administration/configuring-liferay/understanding-configuration-scope.md>`__, you'll understand where to find a certain configuration screen.

* Many search configurations affect the system scope (e.g., re-indexing actions and configuring the search engine connector).
* Search tuning configurations affect the virtual instance.
* Creating new Search Pages affects search at the site scope.
* Configuring the search widgets is widget-scoped configuration, but some can also be thought of as page-scoped configuration.
