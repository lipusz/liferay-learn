The only instance scoped configuration for search are the entries in Control Panel &rarr; Search Tuning:

**Result Rankings:** Customize search results manually by hiding, pinning, and adding results for specific aliases. See [here](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034473872-Search-Tuning-Customizing-Search-Results) for more information.

**Synonyms:** Create synonym sets so that synonymous search terms are matched and scored like an exact match to the search term. See [here](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034473852-Search-Tuning-Synonym-Sets) for more information.
