# Instance Scoped Search Configuration

The only instance scoped configuration for search are the entries in Control Panel &rarr; Search Tuning:

**Result Rankings:** Customize search results manually by hiding, pinning, and adding results for specific aliases. See [Result Rankings](../search-administration-and-tuning/result-rankings.md) for more information.

**Synonyms:** Create synonym sets so that synonymous search terms are matched and scored like an exact match to the search term. See [Synonym Sets](../search-administration-and-tuning/synonym-sets.md) for more information.
